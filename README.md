- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Reach UI](https://reach.tech/) - For Accessible Unstyled Modal
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

This is training material for CSS and React.

### Continued development

Still not confortable with React and Styled Components, should practice more.
